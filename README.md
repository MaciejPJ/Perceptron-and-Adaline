# Perceptron & Adaline Classifiers

This project implements and compares basic linear classification algorithms: **Perceptron**, **Adaline**, and **Adaline with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** using NumPy. The goal is to understand how these models learn and perform on a binary classification problem.
